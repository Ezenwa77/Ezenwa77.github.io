/* Control Flow
*control flow may have more than one statement, in which case the statements are executed in the order top-to-bottom. 
* Control flow may also not be straight. it might have brances, in which case the program takes the proper 
*branch based on the condition at hand. This is called conditional execution.
 conditional execution may go with if, else-if, else, or switch statement.
